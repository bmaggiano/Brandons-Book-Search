# Brandon's Book Search

## Description

This app is a full stack web application that showcases just how powerful the MERN stack is for new developers. We're using Mongo, Express, React, and NodeJS to make our book search application come to life. A user is able to sign up with a new account, or if they already have an account, they're able to log in as well. From there, a JSON web token will be created and active for 2 hours while they're logged in. During this time a user can search for books, save books that they wish to read in the future and then delete the books from their list after they have finished reading them.

To use this app, simply sign up, search for some of your favorite books, add them to your list and trust that your data will be stored and available whenever you're ready to view or delete. GraphQL also played a big part in this project and it further cemented my understanding of TypeDefs, and Resolvers on the server side, and queries and mutations on the client side. This is a wonderful real world application and I can't wait to build more like this in the future!
